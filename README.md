## Contribute
Help is welcome in multiple forms. Below we have listed a few things you can do to help the development of Taivu

### Suggestions and bug reports
Making suggestions and bug reports is perhaps the easiest way to help Taivu grow as a game. You can make them as issues here in the github repository.

### Supplying artwork
I'm not a great artist. As such, art contributions are very welcome. Please do note that you need to own the rights of the artwork in order to be allowed to post it here.

### Translating
Taivu has had a localization system built in from the very beginning. But currently the translations are sadly lacking. You can help greatly by translating the game.

### Programming
You read that right. You can help program Taivu if you want. Even though I feel that Taivu is my baby help is raising it is always welcome. :)
